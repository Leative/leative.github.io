about-author: I am a software engineer, researcher, teacher, and gaming enthusiast. Over the last years, my work focused on software engineering, model-driven development, and optimization heuristics. <br/>-<br/> Recently, my focus has shifted to 3D development and, in particular, Unity. Consequently, this page showcases some of the projects created in the course of excercising various Unity concepts. # add description
